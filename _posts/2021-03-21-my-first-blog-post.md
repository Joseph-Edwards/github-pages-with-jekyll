# This is my first blog post!

I am slowly starting to get the hang of GitHub, which is great news. Soon I plan to take on a new `coding` projectm where I can hopefully implement the skills I have learnt! Until then, will leave you with this quote from Dr. Seuss:

> Sometimes you never know the value of a moment, until it becomes a memory

How sweet is that?
