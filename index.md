# Welcome to my blog

This is my first blog, and I am using it to explore how to use github pages. I am also using it as an exercise in Markdown.

I am demonstrating that I know how to make text **bold**, _italic_ and ~~in strikethrough~~. Markdown is really exciting because, in the words of Joseph Edwards:
> You can do loads of cool stuff with it.

It can also keep track of things I need to do:

- [x] Wake up
- [x] Get breakfast
- [x] Have a shower
- [ ] Go to the shops

I can't wait to do some more cool things.
